# Ignis Lang

> [!CAUTION]

Ignis is a general-purpose programming language with strong, static typing, and immutability by default for variables. 
The languages that inspired Ignis are TypeScript and Rust.
The goal of Ignis is not to be used by everyone but to be a language that allows me to learn how programming languages
are created and work. And, if in the process I can use it to create scripts that replace code written in Bash or other 
languages, especially Lua and Python, that would be ideal.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Rust/Cargo version 1.74 or higher

```bash
cargo install --git https://gitlab.com/Ignis/ignis.git --branch dev
# or
git clone https://gitlab.com/Ignis/ignis.git
cd ignis
cargo install --path . ignis
# Or
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only backend that is currently running is the Lua backend.

```bash
ignis build main.ign
```

## Example Code

```ignis
import { io } from "std::io";

function sum(nums: i64[]): i64 {
  let mut total: i64 = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    total = total + nums[i];
  }

  return total;
}

function main(): void {
  let array: i64[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  io::println("Lenght: " + array.length.toString());

  io::println(sum(array));
}
```
